# Soil smart
Predict soil fertility and give comprehensive agricultural knowledge to farmers based on their soil and questions

## Introduction
This project leverages the power of Generative AI to enhance soil analysis. By using the Replicate with Llama 2-13b model, coupled with a small image analysis network implemented using OpenCV, SoilSmart Image Analysis aims to provide valuable insights into soil quality and composition.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

soil_smart: This folder contains all project files.
main.py: The main project file where the image analysis and Generative AI integration take place.
.stream: This directory houses the secrets file, which is a key component of the project. Ensure that you protect this file and do not share it publicly.
Purpose
SoilSmart Image Analysis serves the purpose of assisting agricultural and environmental experts in analyzing soil samples. By employing image analysis techniques and Generative AI, it offers the following benefits:

Soil Quality Assessment: The project can assess soil quality based on image analysis, helping farmers and environmentalists make informed decisions about soil treatment and conservation.

Composition Analysis: It can provide insights into the composition of soil, including the presence of minerals, organic matter, and other vital components.

Predictive Insights: The Generative AI model, Replicate with Llama 2-13b, aids in making predictions about future soil conditions based on historical data and current observations.

## Generative AI Choice
The choice of using the Replicate with Llama 2-13b Generative AI model was driven by its proven ability to generate high-quality and contextually relevant data. In the context of this project, it enables us to generate valuable insights from soil images, aiding in more accurate soil analysis and predictions.

## Getting Started
To get started with SoilSmart Image Analysis, follow these steps:

## Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can typically install them using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place any soil images you want to analyze in a directory accessible by the main.py script.
Run the main.py script to initiate the analysis. through : streamlit run C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\A2SV\llama\smartFarming\main.py
